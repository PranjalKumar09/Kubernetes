                App
                 ^
                 |   
    Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)
                 ^

        Persistent Volume
                 ^
                 |
        Physical Storage


    First make Persistent Volume like in    host_pv.yml    and    pvc    host_pvc.yml

    Also in     mongo_db_seprate_volume.yml    must have these code snippets

    $ kubectl apply -f host_pv.yml
    $ kubectl apply -f host_pvc.yml
    $ kubectl apply -f mongo_db_seprate_volume.yml

    Also we can see in minikube dashboard in Persistent Volume Claim 


    Now to check this is working or not we can check application by delting and bring mongo-app 

    $ kubectl delete deployment mongo-app
    Now if we check our website then all eariler data will not there

    $ kubectl apply -f mongo_db_seprate_volume.yml
    All data has came

    Even This work in doing downing whole minikube 
    $ minikube stop
    $ minikube start
