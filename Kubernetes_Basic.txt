Kubernetes
==========
    Known as K8s
    Its open source system for
        Automatic Deployment
        Management of Containerized apps
        Scaling
    Support differnt infrastructure (cloud, VMs etc)


    Use Case:
        When Developer want to host website now many problem may arise, overload of server, fail to load server

        Now to tackle this Developer can install server on multiple servers by K8s

Architecture of K8s
====================
    Two important part 
        * Master (Control Plane) &
        * Worker nodes (minions)

    -> Cluster (group of nodes)
    -> Master can be with worker but we should keep it seprate
    -> Master : API server , Schedular, ETCD, Control Manager
    -> Worker nodes : Kubelet , Kube proxy , container-runtime

Components
==========
    * API servers ->  Provide interface (like CLI) called Kubectl
    * Schedular ->  Assign node to newly created 
    * ETCD -> Key value store , having all cluster data
    * Kube controller-> (Control Manager) responsible for managing the state of cluster

    * Kubelet -> Agent make sure container running in pods
    * Continer Runtime -> Maintains network rules for comm with pods
    * Kube proxy -> A tool responsible for running containers
    
    pod -> A single instance of runnnig process in a cluster.
    ---    Can run one or more containers and share same resources.
