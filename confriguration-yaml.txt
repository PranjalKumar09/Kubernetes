YAML config for deployment & service
====================================

    Like docker yaml compose we can make it in kubernetes too.
    Kubenetes config compose can make with any name just its extension should  ".yml

    See   config_compose.yml   
    $ kubectl apply -f config_compose.yml

    By this editing file is very easy

    Similarly we can creatt the service see   service_compose.yml

    Before executing it we must check that if there other with same name we must delete that ones.
    $ kubectl apply -f service_compose.yml
    $ kubectl get services
    $ minikube  service service-my-node-app

    * Error Handling is also easy
