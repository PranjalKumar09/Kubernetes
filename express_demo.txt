    $ npm install
    $ node  index.js

    Then at   localhost:3000   website will come while at if do   /exit  like   localhost:3000/exit   then this port will stop 

    In Kubernetes making it, 

    $ kubectl expose deployment express-demo --type=LoadBalancer --port=3000
    Making service


    Must check by    $ kubectl get pods   
    $ minikube service express-demo

    Now when you checking in dashboard (by  $kubectl dashboard) before & after doing   /exit  in url (url become http://---/exit )
    dashboard will appear in red 
    But Kubernetes will automatically fix it within some time 

    And in pods (by $ kubect get pods) number of restart increase



Scaling our App
==============
    Kubernetes fixes automatically , but it takes atleast few second, do deal with it we havd to scale it (running multiple instances)
    $ kubectl scale deployment express-demo --replicas=4 
    It will run now in 4 pods, pods increase all will visilble in dashboard or  $ kubectl get pods

    Decrease pods further will terminate used upto limit
