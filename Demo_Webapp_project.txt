Demo Webapp project
===================
        
    $ npx create-react-app testapp
    $ cd testapp
    $ npm start
        Output-> 
            Local:            http://localhost:3000
            On Your Network:  http://181.55.171.155:3000

    Now creating Dockerfile in testapp
    Then running following command 
    $ docker build -t pranjalkumar09/webapp-demo:03 . 

    Then after logining to docker 
    $ docker push pranjalkumar09/webapp-demo:03


Deployment of K8s
=================
    $ minikube start
    $ kubectl create deployment my-webapp --image=pranjalkumar09/webapp-demo:03
    
    kubectl get deployments    and    kubectl get pods   for checking

    Even we can check in dashboard by    $ minikube dashboard 
    We can also check logs in terminal    $ kubectl logs <pod-name>

    To get more information of pod    $ kubectl describe pods

    $  kubectl expose  deployment my-webapp --type=LoadBalancer --port=3000
    Our application is inside pod so have to expose the service

    $ minikube service my-webapp 
    Finally Launch it in browser automatically 



Rollout in K8s
==============
    Doing changing in any file and remaking docker image new version and pushing
    $ docker build -t pranjalkumar09/webapp-demo:04 . 
    $ docker push pranjalkumar09/webapp-demo:04

    Now we want to update website but also we don't want to shut it in live environment, we have to connect our container with new image

    $ kubectl rollout status deployment my-webapp
    To know status of deployment

    $ kubectl set image deployment my-webapp webapp-demo=pranjalkumar09/webapp-demo:04

    Old one will continue to run until new one configured , then old one temrinate and remove & new one come & it updated

    When wrong/incorrect image version given it update with new image but it incorrect so ImagePullBackOff & old image (which is correct) will be there .

    
    
    $ kubectl rollout undo deployment my-webapp 
    To undo Rollout the recent change
