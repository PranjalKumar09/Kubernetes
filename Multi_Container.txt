Multi Container
===============
    In this demo project we will collect data (using WEBUI node) and data collected in mongodb using multiple container. Its simple collect & display (older collected ones) emails. Also it have same feature of by adding   '/exit'  to url server stops
sudo lsof -i :3000
    $ docker build -t pranjalkumar09/node-mongo-db:01 .

    $ docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --network my-net --name mongo mongo
    This setup allows your Node.js application to interact with a MongoDB database.

    $ npm install
    $ node index.js
    
    $ docker run --network my-net -p 3000:3000 --name myapp pranjalkumar09/node-mongo-db:01

    After doing  '/exit'

    $ docker start myapp
    We must do this so it can run and eariler data(emails) will also shown after fix


    Two ways to run application with multiple containers:
        -> Run multiple containers in same pod
        -> Run each iner in seprate pod

    
        Run multiple containers in same pod
        -----------------------------------
            First make   Same_pod.yml   and   same_pod_server.yml  then
            $ kubectl apply -f  Same_pod.yml 
            $ kubectl apply -f same_pod_service.yml
            $ minikube service service-my-nodedb-app
           
            In both database have different database


        We can even make this in only one file (one_file.yml) , by just adding    ---   between files

        Run each container in seprate pod
        ---------------------------------
            Steps
            * Changes in node project (dyanmic host and port for database URL)
            * Building image & pushing image with O3 version        
            * YAML config requirement explanation
            * First create depl and service config for MONGO APP so we will be having service name
            * Now create depl and service config for NODE APP and explan how to use env varibales in config
            * Run node-app deployment
